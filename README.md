# UFOs

## Background

A webpage and dynamic table are working as intended, but it is requested to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, also added will be table filters for the city, state, country, and shape.

## Objective

The goal of this challenge is to perform the following:
- Using JavaScript and HTML, modify the code in the index.html file to create more table filters. In addition to the date filter created in this module, add filters for the city, state, country, and shape.
- Provide a written analysis that provides an overview, results, and summary of the project.

## Resources
- html
- css
- JavaScript

## Results

One of the first steps required adding list to the .html file for the filters that were required (city, state, country, shape).  The completed webpage allows the database to refresh after entering given criteria in the "Filter Search" element, and also allows a refresh by clicking on "UFO Sightings" in the top left hand corner.  The page automatically filters after typing in a given feature within the filter search boxes.

## Summary

A couple drawbacks to this page are as follows:
- The webpage is limited in it's small amount of data.
- The webpage filter does not allow users to enter full state names, or show a dropdown prompt to select from.

A few recommendations to improve this page are as follows:
- Additional graphics to make the webpage more visually appealing would be beneficial.
- Including a sum tool that shows how many items/entries match a users filtered results could be beneficial.
- Cleaning up the initial dataset to have every entry in the exact same format would be benficial.  This includes allowing users to search via full state name such as "california" instad of "ca" would be a huge improvement.
